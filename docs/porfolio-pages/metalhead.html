								<p> Numerous people use technology on a daily basis, it is difficult to survive in the
                                    current day and age without it. However, many technology users have no clue about the
                                    disastrous and dangerous processes involved in the creation of their most beloved devices.
                                    “MetalHead” is my attempt at closing this knowledge gap. </p>
                                    <p>I wanted to create something
                                    beautiful enough to pique people’s interests and keep them engaged long enough to learn
                                    about the phenomenon that is metal mining. I classify this project as “environmental media”
                                    because it focuses on educating the general public of the environmental issues they are often
                                    unaware of. </p>
                                    <p>I especially wanted to create some kind of application in order to not waste too
                                    many physical resources, an argument that was explored in class. Specifically, I was trying to
                                    answer the question of “How can we promote awareness for environmental issues without
                                    participating in the extractivist economy?”. While there is no concrete answer, I could at least
                                    make an attempt to minimize the environmental cost of this project.</p>
                                   <p>MetalHead encourages viewers to explore the life cycle of their devices while
                                    understanding the extent to which companies go to in order to produce these products. When
                                    creating this project, I drew inspiration from <a href="https://francoisknoetze.com/">"CORE DUMP”</a>“ where the artist
                                    takes viewers on a journey through the lifecycle of technology. </p>
