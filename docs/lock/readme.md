# Pop the Lock
This one button game was orginally made with Processing in Java. I decided to remake it in javascript (with p5.js) so it could be played within the browser.
  * the java code was made as an assignment for a class and can be found [here](https://github.com/prach19/EECS1710_PROJECTS/tree/main/MIDTERM_PROJECT).
